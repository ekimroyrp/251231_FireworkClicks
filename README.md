# 251231_FireworkClicks

FireworkClicks is a lightweight playground for experimenting with click-driven fireworks visuals and simple score-friendly interactions. The repo starts as a clean scaffold so effects and gameplay can be layered in quickly.

## Features
- Contribution guardrails captured in `Guardrails.txt`.
- Clean starting point ready for adding visuals, input handling, and scoring logic.
- Placeholder notes for the planned click-to-firework loop.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ekimroyrp/251231_FireworkClicks.git`
- Open the folder in your editor to begin adding the game or simulation code.
- No runtime dependencies yet; introduce your preferred engine/build setup as you implement features.

## Controls
